Wow that was a learning experince. To build this thing you need to do
the following.

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev
$ opam install conf-sdl-image
$ opam install ocamlsdl

The first opam install there may not be needed, not sure. Now you have
to know how to link the library. The trick is that OPAM just uses findlib, so you need to use 

$ ocamlfind list

to figure out what the packages are actually called. Then you link
them using PACKS for OCamlMakefile.
